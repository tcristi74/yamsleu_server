# yams-leu
yams-leu = Yahtzee style game, but way more complex. Though it's played with five dices, it is all about strategy. Yes, luck might be involved and sometimes badly needed but the game is closer to chess that craps I would say.

## Quick History

We used to play this game in the late 90's while living in my home city of Bucharest. It started while I was a student at Politehnica, playing mostly in two of the university cafeterias :TCM and Leu. No woder my grades were not that good.
Strangely enough, the game in each cafeteria was a little different. Then I continued playing with friends for few years but life moved on rapidly... and I totally forgot about yams. Two years back we got an event in the house and we decided, why not, to play yams again. Then I spent 1n hour searching the web for rules or any type of information of the game. I just couldnâ€™t find anything, the game had vanished, or maybe there never articles about it, as it was few years earlier the web explosion. And I started to understand that the this game was only played into that miniature world of Politehnica/Electronica students. Wow, this was a surprise. Lucky enough, after localizing searches and keywords for Romania only, I was able to find ONLY one entry, but a great detailed blog about the game, including rules and everything. That was all I needed, thank you Cristina for the article
So, I feel that I got to do this now, hope I can see it through.
